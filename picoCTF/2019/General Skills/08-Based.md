To get truly 1337, you must understand different data encodings, such as hexadecimal or binary. Can you get the flag from this program to prove you are on the way to becoming 1337? Connect with `nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 29956`.

Hints:
- I hear python can convert things.
- It might help to have multiple windows open.
