# First Grep
Can you find the flag in [file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/515f19f3612bfd97cd3f0c0ba32bd864/file)? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

Hints:
- grep [tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/grep.php)

## Solución
``` bash
holiwiscach@ubuntu:~$ grep 'picoCTF' file
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}


```
