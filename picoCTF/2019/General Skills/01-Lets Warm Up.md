If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

Hints:
- Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

## Soluci√≥n
p
``` bash
holiwiscach@ubuntu:~$ echo -e "\x70"
p
```

picoCTF{p}
